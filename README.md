# Explorer-Visualizer
Simple script to visualize a media folder
Warning this is not an example of good code, in fact this is an example of very bad code so do what you will with that information.

To run the script you need pygame
	> pip install pygame

Once you have pygame install put the script in the root of your media folder ie)

	>Media
		>TV_SHOWS
			Main.py <---------------------------- Script goes here
			>SHOW 1
				>Season 1
					>SHOW 1 S01E01.mkv
				>Season 2
			>SHOW 2
		>MOVIES

Then just run it as :
	> python ./Main.py
